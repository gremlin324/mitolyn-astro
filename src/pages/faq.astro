    questions: [
      {
        q: 'Is Mitolyn right for me?',
        a: 'If you have deep stubborn fat stores that no diet or exercise seems to remove, then Mitolyn is right for you. Mitolyn has changed the lives of thousands of women and men from 18 to 80 and is designed to rapidly liquefy fat even in the worst cases.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How does Mitolyn work?',
        a: 'Mitolyn works by boosting mitochondrial function—the "powerhouses" of your cells that burn fat and create energy. With 6 clinically-researched ingredients, Mitolyn increases your cellular energy production, helping your body burn more calories throughout the day.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What makes Mitolyn different from other supplements?',
        a: 'Most weight-loss supplements focus on appetite suppression or stimulants. Mitolyn is unique because it targets the root cause: low mitochondrial levels. By enhancing your cellular energy factories, Mitolyn helps you burn fat naturally and sustainably.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Safety & Quality',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'Is Mitolyn safe?',
        a: 'Yes. Mitolyn is a natural proprietary formula manufactured in an FDA-registered and GMP-certified facility using state-of-the-art, precision-engineered machinery under the strictest sterile standards. Each ingredient is 100% plant-based, soy-free, dairy-free, non-GMO, and undergoes third-party testing. As always, consult your physician before taking if you\'re pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or have a medical condition.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Are there any side effects?',
        a: 'Mitolyn is made with natural, plant-based ingredients and is generally well-tolerated. As with any supplement, some individuals may experience mild digestive adjustments when first starting. If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Is Mitolyn tested for purity?',
        a: 'Absolutely. Every batch of Mitolyn undergoes rigorous third-party testing for purity, potency, and contaminants. We maintain the highest quality standards to ensure you\'re getting exactly what\'s on the label.',

    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Dosage & Usage',
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How many bottles should I order?',
        a: 'If you\'re over 35 years old or carry excess weight, we recommend taking Mitolyn for at least 3 to 6 months so it has enough time to work throughout your entire body to support healthy mitochondria levels, reach your desired weight, and lock it in for years into the future. Every 3-bottle package comes with 2 bonus eBooks absolutely free. Or make the smart decision and get the heavily discounted 6-bottle package with 2 bonus eBooks plus free shipping.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What\'s the best way to take Mitolyn?',
        a: 'Take one capsule of Mitolyn with a big glass of cold water every day. Our proprietary blend will get to work dissolving fat for you even while sleeping.',
      },
      {
        q: 'When should I take Mitolyn?',
        a: 'For best results, take Mitolyn consistently at the same time each day. Many customers prefer taking it in the morning with breakfast to support their metabolism throughout the day.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I take Mitolyn with other supplements?',
        a: 'While Mitolyn can generally be taken alongside other supplements, we recommend consulting your healthcare provider before combining it with other products, especially if you\'re on prescription medications.',

    questions: [
      {
        q: 'How long until I see results?',
        a: 'Most users report noticing increased energy and reduced cravings within the first few weeks.

      },
      {
        q: 'Will I gain the weight back after stopping?',
        a: 'Unlike quick-fix diets, Mitolyn works by enhancing your mitochondrial function—your cellular "engines." By taking it for 3-6 months as recommended, you\'re essentially upgrading your body\'s fat-burning capacity. Combined with healthy habits, these changes tend to be lasting.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Does Mitolyn work without diet and exercise?',
        a: 'While Mitolyn can help boost your metabolism and energy, combining it with a balanced diet and regular exercise will maximize your results. Mitolyn enhances your body\'s natural fat-burning ability when you\'re taking action toward your goals.',
